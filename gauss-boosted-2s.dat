# Syntax of this file is the following:
# Lines starting with # are comments
# Parameters are given as a pair key:value
# Values are in units of GeV^n and possible keys are:
# e_f, m_f, M_V, N_T, N_L, R, S alpha and del
#
#
#e_f: Effective charge: 2/3
e_f:0.66666666
#N_T, N_L, R_T, R_L: Normalization for transversial/lognitudial components
N_T:0.739443
N_L:0.72843 
R:1.85117 
m_f:1.4
M_V:3.68609
# delta: 0 or 1: one part of the wave functio is multiplied by delta
del:1
# State S=n, J/Psi is S=1
S:2
# alpha needed for higher S states, no effect for S=1
