# Parameters for upsilon and \gamma^* wave function overlap
# 
# Model: Boosted gaussian 
#
# Parameters from arXiv:0905.0102 (only transverse)
#
# Syntax of this file is the following:
# Lines starting with # are comments
# Parameters are given as a pair key:value
# Values are in units of GeV^n and possible keys are:
# e_f, m_f, M_V, N_T, N_L, R, S alpha,alpha2 and del
#
#
#e_f: Effective charge: 
e_f:0.333333
#N_T, N_L, R_T, R_L: Normalization for transversial/lognitudial components
#In 0905.0102 normalization factor 0.481 for the scalar part is given
N_T:0.668
N_L:0
#sqrt(1.028)
R:1.013903348
m_f:4.20
M_V:10.3552
# delta: 0 or 1: one part of the wave functio is multiplied by delta
del:1
# State S=n, J/Psi is S=1
S:3
# alpha needed for higher S states, no effect for S=1
