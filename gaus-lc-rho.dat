# Parameters for rho and \gamma^* wave function overlap
# 
# Model: Gaus-LC
# Parameters are taken from an article by Kowalski, Motyka 
# and Watt, see arXiv: hep-ph/0606272v2

# Syntax of this file is the following:
# Lines starting with # are comments
# Parameters are given as a pair key:value
# Values are in units of GeV^n and possible keys are:
# e_f, m_f, M_V, N_T, N_L, R_T, R_L and del
